# Pawmodoro Timer App

## Things I learned:
- How to use Font Awesome React in my project for timer controls
- How to disable buttons with functions and props with logic
- More practice refactoring and using React


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
